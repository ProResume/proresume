# Pro-Resume
Scoring an interview is a challenge for any job seeker these days, thus having a unique and well-organized resume is crucial to grab a recruiter’s attention. Online resume builders such as Resume Now and Visualize Me have been created to help users build resumes; though, their templates are very limited in quantity, have little customization, and in some instances, are unreadable. Thus, our team has decided to create an infographic online resume builder, a web application that allows its users to build, organize, and beautify their resumes and ultimately develop unique and competitive resumes. Our system also allows for easy integration with their LinkedIn profiles so that their work history can be easily duplicated without typing everything out. There is also a large scope of infographic template options that users can choose from and, most importantly, users will have the ability to further customize the content and organization by using the system’s editing mode.
